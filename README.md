#Energy Consumption Analysis and Optimization

##Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing energy consumption data collected from smart home devices. By identifying usage patterns and predicting future energy needs, the project aims to propose actionable strategies to optimize energy usage, reduce costs, and minimize environmental impact.

#Features

Data Cleaning: Handles missing values and converts data types for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes trends, identifies correlations, and detects anomalies.
Feature Engineering: Extracts time-based features such as hour, day, and weekend/weekday classifications.
Modeling:
1.Time-series forecasting using ARIMA.
2.Random Forest Regression for predictive modeling.
Optimization Recommendations: Identifies peak consumption periods and provides strategies to manage energy use.
Dataset
The dataset contains over 1 million records with the following columns:

Date: Date of measurement.
Time: Time of measurement.
Global_active_power: Power used by the household (in kW).
Global_reactive_power: Reactive power used.
Voltage: Voltage measurements.
Global_intensity: Current intensity (in A).
Sub_metering_1, Sub_metering_2, Sub_metering_3: Energy usage in different sub-metering areas.


##Results

ARIMA Model: Forecasts energy consumption for the next 7 days.
Random Forest Regression:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): ~0.0024
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): ~0.0043
RÂ² Score: ~0.9984
Recommendations: Includes peak consumption warnings and cost-saving suggestions.
