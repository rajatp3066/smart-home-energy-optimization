# Energy Consumption Optimization for Smart Homes

This project analyzes energy consumption data from smart home devices (e.g., thermostats, lighting, and appliances) to predict energy usage patterns. The goal is to suggest optimization strategies that reduce energy costs and minimize environmental impact by analyzing consumption behavior.

# Project Overview
The objective of this project is to use historical energy consumption data to:

Understand patterns of energy usage in smart homes.
Predict future energy consumption.
Propose actionable optimization strategies to reduce energy costs and minimize the carbon footprint.

# Key Features

Data Cleaning: Preprocessing data by handling missing values and scaling features.
Feature Engineering: Generating additional time-based features for modeling.
Predictive Modeling: Using machine learning (Random Forest Regression) and Time Series analysis (ARIMA) to forecast energy usage.
Optimization Strategies: Providing suggestions for energy consumption reduction.

Modeling and Evaluation
Random Forest Regression
The Random Forest model is used to predict energy consumption patterns based on various features. It was evaluated using metrics like R², MAE, and RMSE.

Example Evaluation:

bash
Copy code
MAE: 0.35
RMSE: 0.45
R²: 0.9984
Time Series Forecasting (ARIMA)
An ARIMA model is used to predict future energy consumption, considering time-based patterns.

Model Evaluation Metrics
R² (Coefficient of Determination): Indicates the proportion of variance explained by the model.
MAE (Mean Absolute Error): Measures the average magnitude of errors in predictions.
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Measures the standard deviation of prediction errors.
Optimization Strategies
Based on the predicted energy consumption, the following optimization strategies are suggested:

Peak Hour Reduction: Minimize energy consumption during peak hours to reduce costs.
Device Management: Turn off non-essential devices during periods of high energy usage.
HVAC Optimization: Use predictive models to adjust heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems based on forecasted energy needs.
